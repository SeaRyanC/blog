No training wheels!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To me, this was surprising. Didn't everyone know by now that training wheels aren't necessary, or even desirable, to teach bicycling?</p>\n<p>A few weeks later at a campsite, I saw a kid around age 5, riding a bicycle with training wheels.\nIt was just sad.\nHe couldn't even keep up with the pair of three-year-olds ripping around the park, and even got stuck.\nHow was this kid ever going to enjoy biking if this is what he thought biking was?</p>\n<h1 id=\"skip-the-training-wheels\" tabindex=\"-1\">Skip the Training Wheels <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://searyanc.dev/posts/no-training-wheels/#skip-the-training-wheels\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>If you learn only one thing, please let it be this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you think your child isn't ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, get them a balance bike.</p>\n<p>If you think your kid is ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, put them on one.</p>\n<p>Everything else on this page is fluff.\nAbove all else, Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle.</p>\n<h1 id=\"training-wheels-are-bad\" tabindex=\"-1\">Training Wheels Are Bad <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://searyanc.dev/posts/no-training-wheels/#training-wheels-are-bad\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Right now, you might be saying</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But why?

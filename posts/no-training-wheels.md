# "Wow! No Training Wheels!"

I taught my son how to ride a bicycle when he turned three.
It quickly became his favorite thing to do, because riding a bicycle is incredibly fun for kids!
They can finally keep up with adults, they can see more of the world, and it's just plain exciting to go a little fast.

We'd go for rides around the neighborhood and various empty parking lots, and the most common thing I heard people say was

> Wow! No training wheels!

To me, this was surprising. Didn't everyone know by now that training wheels aren't necessary, or even desirable, to teach bicycling?

A few weeks later at a campsite, I saw a kid around age 5, riding a bicycle with training wheels.
It was just sad.
He couldn't even keep up with the pair of three-year-olds ripping around the park, and even got stuck a few times when his rear wheel hit a dip in the pavement.
How was this kid ever going to enjoy biking if this is what he thought biking was?

## Skip the Training Wheels

If you learn only one thing, please let it be this:

> Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle

If you think your child isn't ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, get them a balance bike.

If you think your kid is ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, put them on one.

Everything else on this page is fluff.
Above all else, Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle.

## Training Wheels Are Bad

Right now, you might be saying

> But why? I learned to bike on training wheels!

This is actually a myth.
The fact is, no one learned to read a bike on training wheels.

Everyone who learned how to ride a bike with training wheels did that, then learned a separate and mostly unrelated skills of how to ride a bike *without* training wheels.
In every area that matters, a bike with training wheels is a different kind of vehicle which requires different skills.

### They Don't Teach Bicycle Skills

Riding a bicycle consists of five main subskills that you must master:

1. **Pedaling**: Make the bike go forward by pushing the pedals (easy)
1. **Cornering**: At low speeds, rotate the handlebars to turn (easy)
1. **Braking**: Make the bike stop by engaging the brakes (easy)
1. **Leaning**: At high speeds, using body weight shifts to turn (medium)
1. **Balance Recovery**: At low speeds, rotate the handlebars to prevent falling (hard)

Bicycles with training wheels help you learn the easy skills, but fail to teach you the harder skills.

#### Pedaling

Kids generally figure out pedaling in an hour or two tops.
It's easily within their strength capacity, and the motion is close enough to walking that it doesn't require any dedicated learning effort.
You don't need training wheels to learn how to pedal.

#### Cornering

At low speeds (about walking pace or slower), the primary mechanism to turn a bike is to turn the handlebars in the direction you want to go.
This is how tricycles work, for example.

When riding a bike with training wheels, cornering is the *only* way to turn, because training wheels prevent the bike from leaning far enough to do a lean-based turn.
As a result, kids learning on bikes with training wheels only learn tricycle-style steering, and have to re-learn how to navigate a turn once the training wheels come off.

Training wheels teach kids to ride their bike like a tricycle, but bicycles aren't tricycles.

#### Braking

Braking is also pretty easy for kids to figure out.
Especially for bikes with coaster brakes, braking is also the result of pedaling the wrong way, so it tends to get learned concurrently with pedaling.
You don't need training wheels to learn how to brake.

#### Leaning

This is the first major failure mode for training wheels.
On a bicycle, steering the bike is largely accomplished through body weight shifts with accompanying small adjustments to the handlebars.



#### Balance Recovery

We need a little basic physics to explain this one.
Anything not fastened to the ground will tip over if its *center of mass* is outside the *contact points* the thing has with the ground.

For a human standing on two feet, that means if you lean over far enough that your center of mass is outside the area defined by where your two feet touch the ground, you will start falling over.

For a bicycle on two wheels, that means if the rider leans over enough that the center of mass is outside the area defined by the front and rear wheel, the bike will start tipping over.

Obviously for a bike, we're unlikely to get our center of mass in front of the front wheel, or behind the rear wheel, but it's very easy to have our center of mass be to the left or right of the area between the wheels.

When our center of mass is to one side, the bike starts tipping.
At higher speeds, complex mechanisms counteract this tip more or less automatically, but at lower speeds, those mechanisms aren't strong enough to stop a tip from starting.

What happens next depends on whether or not our bike has training wheels.

For a bike with training wheels, here's what happens:

1. The rider's balance is slightly off; let's say to the left. The center of mass is to the left of the wheels.
1. The bicycle starts tipping to the left as a result
1. The left training wheel hits the ground
1. The rider learns nothing about what to do in this situation

For a bike without training wheels, here's what happens:

1. The rider's balance is slightly off; let's say to the left. The center of mass is to the left of the wheels.
1. The bicycle starts tipping to the left as a result
1. To recover, the rider pushes the handlebars to the left
1. The bike moves forward a little bit, with the front wheel moving to the left because the front wheeel has turned
1. The center of mass is now between the front and rear wheel again
1. At this point, the rider straightens the handlebars
1. The bike naturally uprights itself

At step 3, the rider can also choose to fall over.


## They're Boring

## They're Not a Bicycle

## Balance Bikes Are Good

## Gearing Up

## Age Appropriateness

## Transitioning to Pedals

## Starting

## Braking



# Common Mistakes

## Mistake: Death Grip

Hold the kid, not the bike.

## Mistake: Seat Too High

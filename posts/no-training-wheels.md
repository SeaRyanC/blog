# "Wow! No Training Wheels!"

I taught my son how to ride a bicycle right when he turned three.
It quickly became his favorite thing to do, because riding a bicycle is incredibly fun for kids!
They can finally keep up with adults, they can see more of the world, and it's just plain exciting to go a little fast.

We'd go for rides around the neighborhood and various empty parking lots, and the most common thing I heard people say was

> Wow! No training wheels!

To me, this was surprising. Didn't everyone know by now that training wheels aren't necessary, or even desirable, to teach bicycling?

A few weeks later at a campsite, I saw a kid around age 5, riding a bicycle with training wheels.
It was just sad.
He couldn't even keep up with the pair of three-year-olds ripping around the park, and even got stuck.
How was this kid ever going to enjoy biking if this is what he thought biking was?

# Skip the Training Wheels

If you learn only one thing, please let it be this:

> Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle

If you think your child isn't ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, get them a balance bike.

If you think your kid is ready for a true two-wheeled bicycle, put them on one.

Everything else on this page is fluff.
Above all else, Don't Put Training Wheels a Bicycle.

# Training Wheels Are Bad

Right now, you might be saying

> But why? I learned to bike on training wheels!

The fact is: no one learned to read a bike on training wheels.
